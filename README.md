Understanding JDK, JRE, JVM

Collaborators: Leonel Joseph, Jeffrey Monsalve
 

1. What are JDK, JRE and JVM? It should be in your own words and not more than two unambiguous sentences for each.

   JDK, which stands for Java Development Kit, It is a package used to develop Java applications and convert Java code to Byte Codes. The conversion is usually done by    using Java compilers.

   


2. What is the relation between the three (JDK, JRE, JVM)? How is Java code executed in a Java program. Explain by assuming that the program was written on one platform (e.g., Windows) and executed on another (e.g., Linux). Small paragraph of 6-9 sentences.

   

3. With the help of the code for Hello World program in Java (you can copy code with citation), explain when this program needs JDK (and not JRE and JVM), JRE (and not JVM) and JVM.

    

    
4. Modify the document at least twice each person to make it better and show your competency to do version control using github.


Question: How Java is Portable?(Trivial Question Proposition?)

Question: How does the program data change when a program is handed from JDK to JRE to JVM? (Sample)
